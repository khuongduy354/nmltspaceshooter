# Player design
- space or wasd control
- fly and shoot

# Boss Design 

- always target player
- have many shooting states in BossStateManager.gd (FSM)
- pick state randomly based on %
- movement: if close enough player orbit, else chase (fly straight toward player)
- boss shooting: has 12 guns in total, surrounding itself (2 consecutive guns differ an angle 
of 30 degrees)

# SFX and VFX

- use godot physics particle system

- use shaders: white flash,

- sources:

- animation: godot animation player, keyframe properties: Sprite.frame


# Enemy Design 

- 1 Gun 

- patrol, idle, chasing states (fsm)

- detect player if in zone -> chase (fly toward player and attack)

- player out range -> idle

- idle for some times -> patrol (move a bit)



# Asteroids Design

- 3 sizes: big small medium

- big destroyed -> 2 medium, medium destroyed -> 2 small

- only big has collision detection


# Spawners Design

- spawn mobs every X interval

- max_mobs_count limit mobs on map that spawner can have at a time
